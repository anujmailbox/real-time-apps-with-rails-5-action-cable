## Instructor: [Markus Mühlberger][instructor url]


Real-time communication is vital for modern web applicationsAction Cable is a new part of Rails 5 that allows you to create real-time communication between the browser and the server. This comes out of the box with Rails 5—no more external services or Socket.io setup.

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Markus Mühlberger will show you how to get started with Action Cable in Rails 5. You'll see how to build a complete real-time app with back-end Ruby on Rails, and front-end CoffeeScript with jQuery: a scoreboard for baseball games. You'll get some pointers on creating efficient communication to the server and you'll see how to deploy a real-time app to Heroku.
